# Predict Next Fashion 👗🧠

Machine learning project exploring **fashion trend prediction** using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.  
Developed as part of a data analytics learning project to forecast which fashion items are likely to trend next.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Predict the next trending fashion item based on historical data such as:
- Category, color, price range
- Engagement or popularity metrics
- Seasonality or posting date

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn (modeling, scaling)
